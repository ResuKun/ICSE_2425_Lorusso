# Per RLCard, un round nel Burraco Ã¨ una mano intera, 
# ovvero dalla distribuzione delle carte alla chiusura

#questo vuol dire dover gestire:
#   - shuffle delle carte
#   - porre la prima carta del monte degli scarti
#   - creazione del pozzo (TOBE)
#   - distribuzione delle carte
#   - inizia il turno del primo giocatore
